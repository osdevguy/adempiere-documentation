# Calendar, Year and Periods

The Calendar, Year and Periods define the date-based grouping of financial data used in the reporting system. The accounting consequences of a particular document are posted into one Period determined by the Accounting Date used by the document. The Calendar Year and Periods are common across all Accounting Schema defined.

While it is possible to define multiple Calendars, only one is used at a time. The _**Client**_ window, _**Client Info**_ tab selects which Calendar will be used. If the selected Calendar is changed, it will affect any subsequent accounting postings, not the currently posted data. To change the currently posted data, the accounting data should be reset.

## Calendar

The Calendar setup is straight forward. An initial Calendar will have been created for the Client and this can be modified or a new one defined.
