# Warehouse Management System

Usually the sales department creates Sales Orders _SO_ using alternative Delivery Rules:

| Delivery Rule |
| :--- |
| Full Line Delivery |
| Full Order Delivery |

## Distribution Plan

This report comes out of executing a standard process, basically shows current status of items to be delivered, it allows to consolidate commitments from previous orders in order to generate a delivery plan, this in turn allows to create Outbound Orders based on the items to be delivered.

## Distribution Order

Commonly known as _DO_ it feeds from the commitments made out of the Sales Orders based on availability of the line items involved.
