### Description

The Calendar tool provides a method to find dates using a standard month calendar. There are two forms of the Calendar tool, date only or date and time, as shown below.

| Format | Java Client | Web |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Date | ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/swing_calendartool_date.png) | ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/zk_calendartool_date.png) |
| Date + Time | ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/swing_calendartool_datetime.png) | The Web interface uses a separate field for the time element. |

Which form appears depends on the data type of the field being entered. The menu link and most date fields are [date only](../entering-data-fields-and-buttons/date-field.md). The time portion will appear if the data type is set to [date & time \(time stamp\)](http://wiki.adempiere.net/Entering_Data_-_Fields_and_Buttons#Date.2BTime).

The Web version of the control is much simpler and only allows selection of a date.

Using the Java Client Calendar tool is easy. Use the controls to select the month and year and then **double click** the date. For the date/time version, there is also a handy check mark icon which you can click.

There are three icons to assist you:

* C - Clear - will clear the date in the date field
* x - Cancel - close the Calendar tool, making no changes
* \* - Today - set today's date

The following keyboard controls can be used:

* &lt;Pg Dn&gt; will increment the month
* &lt;Pg Up&gt; will decrement the month
* &lt;Up Arrow&gt; will decrement by a week
* &lt;Down Arrow&gt; will increment by a week
* &lt;Left Arrow&gt; will decrement by a day
* &lt;Right Arrow&gt; will increment by a day
* &lt;Enter&gt; will close the Calendar tool, saving the date/time if the tool was opened from a field.
* &lt;Esc&gt; will cancel the and close the tool.
