# Role Access Update

When changes are made to the Application Dictionary such as creating new menu items or windows, the user roles that need to use these new entries have to be updated to have access to them.  The easiest way of doing so is to update the roles using the Role Access Update process.

The Process is found in the **System Administration -&gt; General Rules -&gt; Security** menu as the **Role Access Update** process.

This process takes two parameters:

* **Client**; and
* **Role**

To update a single role, select that role in the **Role** parameter.  To update all roles for a Client, leave the **Role** parameter blank. 

To update all roles in all clients, set the **Client** parameter to "_System_".
